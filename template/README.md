# Spark Engine Project

## Directory Structure

- **/assets/nodes**: Contains the nodes in the multi-agent system project flow.
- **/assets/edges**: Contains the connections between nodes, indicating which nodes are connected to each other.
- **/assets/agents**: Contains the agents that can be assigned to agent nodes.

## /resources Folder

- **/resources**: This folder should not be touched. It contains the schematics for the project's nodes, agents, and edges. These schematics are needed when compiling into an executable Spark Engine project.
